# Travel Attraction Recommender with Doc2Vec

This project is a recommendation system designed to suggest tourist attractions based on user preferences and feedback. It leverages the Doc2Vec model to create vector representations of textual descriptions of attractions, enabling personalized recommendations that align with user interests.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides suggestions tailored to user input and preferences.
- **Doc2Vec Integration**: Utilizes Gensim's Doc2Vec for efficient vectorization of text data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle a diverse set of attraction data for larger applications.
- **Interactive Interface**: (Include if applicable: e.g., web-based, CLI, or mobile app.)

## Example Results
Below are example results showcasing how the model performs during testing:
